# üë©‚Äçüíª REST API for maintaining messages

## About api-messages-php
The following statements are true about a message:
* it has a non-guessable identifier (UUID v4),
* it can contain characters coming from different languages,
* it does not support the usage of html tags,
* it has a maximum number of chars (255 characters),
* e-mail(s) and http link(s) can be part of the message,
* it has an internal counter of how many times the message was
retrieved (unsigned number)

## System dependencies
* built on macOS Catalina Version 10.15.3
* PHP 7.3.11
* mysql Ver 8.0.23 for osx10.15 on x86_64 (Homebrew)

## Database

## localhost or deployed version
Your can test the API either on your localhost or on the deployed version with the base URL https://api-messages-php.herokuapp.com/api/message

### Prerequsites localhost
In order to use the API locally, run the apache server with the command `sudo apachectl start` and run the mysql server for example by running the command `mysql.server start` (depending on how mysql was installed, this may vary from machine to machine).
Move the project folder api-messages-php into your Sites folder (~/Sites). If you don't have a Sites folder create one and change your server settings accordingly.

Create a database with the credentials: 

```
    private $host = "localhost";
    private $db_name = "apimessages";
    private $username = "root";
    private $password = "123456";
```
and create a table with the following SQL statement:

```
CREATE TABLE messages (
  uuid INT(128) NOT 0,
  content VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  counter INT UNSIGNED DEFAULT 0 DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY ( uuid )
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER init_uuid BEFORE INSERT ON messages
  FOR EACH ROW SET NEW.uuid = UUID();
//
DELIMITER ;
```
For the following instructions when using localhost use the base URL http://localhost/api/message

The API responds to different types of requests, which will be explained below.
Use a ‚ÄúRest Client‚Äù like Postman.
